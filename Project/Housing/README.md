## Project Overview  

In this project, we aim to:

- Estimate the price of real estate based on location and size.  
- Predict the future evolution of property prices in cities or departments over the years 2018-2019 and 2019-2020.  

## Steps Involved

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:  
- Collected data from 2014 to 2018.
- Preprocessed the data by cleaning and merging relevant columns.
- Removed outliers and filled missing values.

2. Machine Learning Models:
- Implemented various models to predict property prices and price trends.
- Used Linear Regression, GridSearchCV, RandomForest, and LSTM models.

3. Visualization and Implementation:
- Created a JSON file containing the mean price per square meter and year-on-year evolution.
- Developed a website using OpenStreetMap to visualize the data.
- Added features to display the price per square meter and the evolution for each department and city.
